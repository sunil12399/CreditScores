# Analyzing Credit Scores in R

Exploring what differentiates consumer credit score levels and demonstrate how dimensionality reduction can retain much of the information in a dataset while reducing its size. We'll use the `embed` and `tidymodels` to build UMAP and decision tree models. We will to demonstrate the concept of information by comparing the performance of decision tree models before and after applying UMAP dimensionality reduction.
